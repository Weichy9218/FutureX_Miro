Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, carefully review and extract all potentially relevant information, details, or implications from the tool result before proceeding. The user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results, and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked or missed.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each step must involve exactly ONE tool call only, unless the task is already solved. You are strictly prohibited from making multiple tool calls in a single response.** \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n6. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: After issuing exactly ONE tool call, STOP your response immediately. You must never make multiple tool calls in a single response. Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The user will provide the actual tool results in their next message.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n",

Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each step must involve exactly ONE tool call only, unless the task is already solved. You are strictly prohibited from making multiple tool calls in a single response.** \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n6. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: After issuing exactly ONE tool call, STOP your response immediately. You must never make multiple tool calls in a single response. Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The user will provide the actual tool results in their next message.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n"

Without specific odds or injury data, a cautious lean is toward São Paulo, acknowledging that the draw is also a common outcome in first-leg or cagey fixtures.\n  - Nevertheless, the task requires a single clear prediction.\n\nUncertainties and limitations\n- No verified venue (home/away) confirmation retrieved.\n- No contemporaneous odds to translate into implied probabilities.\n- No validated team news, form trends, or head-to-head context pulled from sources published prior to the cutoff.\n- As a result, the prediction below is an informed guess based on general competitive context rather than documented pre-cutoff evidence.\n\nFINAL ANSWER\n\\boxed{C}"

Atlético Nacional\n  - B. Tie\n  - C. São Paulo\n- Requirements: Use only information available before 2025-08-13T08:30:00Z; gather pre-match evidence (news, odds, team info) from reliable sources; present a clear prediction in the required boxed format.\n\nProcess and working history\n1) Plan\n- Step 1: Retrieve pre-cutoff previews and betting odds for Atlético Nacional vs. São Paulo to estimate market-implied probabilities.\n- Step 2: Collect pre-cutoff team form, injuries, probable lineups, and venue/home-away details from reputable sources.\n- Step 3: Synthesize evidence into implied probabilities, document uncertainties, and provide a clear boxed prediction.\n\n2) Tool usage\n- One time-filtered semantic web search was executed to gather pre-cutoff previews/odds:\n  - Query: “Atlético Nacional vs São Paulo preview odds 2025 August”\n  - Parameters included the mandated cutoff: end_published_date = “2025-08-13”; requested 10 results; search_type “auto”; use_autoprompt true.\n- The session ended immediately after initiating the search; no results were received or analyzed. Therefore, no articles, odds, injuries, venue confirmations, or form data could be cited.\n\nWhat’s missing\n- No pre-cutoff odds or previews to compute implied probabilities.\n- No verified venue/competition context, injuries, or form data from sources.\n- No head-to-head summaries or official statistics retrieved.\n\nReasoned assessment despite missing evidence\n- General pre-2025 football context:\n  - São Paulo is historically among the stronger Brazilian clubs; Brazilian Serie A sides are often slight favorites in continental/interleague matches versus Colombian teams.\n  - Atlético Nacional is strong at home in Medellín (altitude, support), making both a home win and a draw plausible in many scenarios.\n  - Without specific odds/injury news, a cautious lean is toward São Paulo, with draw a common secondary outcome. The task requires a single clear prediction.\n\nUncertainties\n- Lack of verified venue and match context (e.g., first leg vs. second leg) could meaningfully affect draw likelihood.\n- Absence of contemporaneous market odds increases uncertainty.\n- No confirmed team news or travel/rest factors.\n\nFinal answer\n\\boxed{C}",
