Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, carefully review and extract all potentially relevant information, details, or implications from the tool result before proceeding. The user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results, and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked or missed.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each step must involve exactly ONE tool call only, unless the task is already solved. You are strictly prohibited from making multiple tool calls in a single response.** \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n6. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: After issuing exactly ONE tool call, STOP your response immediately. You must never make multiple tool calls in a single response. Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The user will provide the actual tool results in their next message.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n",

Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n6. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: After issuing exactly ONE tool call, STOP your response immediately. You must never make multiple tool calls in a single response. Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The user will provide the actual tool results in their next message.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n"

The session ended before any results were returned or analyzed.\n\nReasoning and Basis for Final Prediction (Given Incomplete Evidence)\n- Without retrieved pre-cutoff data, I rely on general priors as of before August 2025:\n  - Team strength: Benfica are traditionally a top club in Portugal with strong ELO/club coefficients, deep squads, and strong preseason campaigns; Nice are competitive in Ligue 1 but generally rated slightly below Europe’s top-15 clubs, with variable attacking output.\n  - Likely context: Mid-August could be late preseason or early competitive qualifiers/supercups depending on calendars. If a friendly or neutral-venue match, outcomes can be more variance-prone; if hosted by Benfica, home advantage would increase Benfica’s edge. The given kickoff of ~03:00Z hints at a potential overseas (e.g., North America) venue, which can reduce home advantage but still often sees the stronger squad favored.\n  - Market tendency: In friendlies or neutral matches between a top Portuguese champion-contender and a solid Ligue 1 side, bookmakers usually price the stronger club (Benfica) as favorite, with draw second, and the underdog win least likely.\n\nUncertainties\n- Competition type (friendly vs. competitive), exact venue, and precise squad availability are unknown.\n- No pre-match odds or statistical previews could be retrieved due to session cutoff.\n- If the match were a competitive tie (e.g., qualifying leg, Super Cup style, or a structured tournament), the draw probability could rise depending on format and incentives.\n\nPlausible Options Identified\n- A (Benfica): Most plausible based on team strength and typical pre-match pricing.\n- B (Tie): Plausible, especially if preseason/neutral venue or early-season match dynamics.\n- C (Nice): Less likely but possible given preseason variability and neutral sites.\n\nFinal Answer\n\\boxed{A}"

I did not receive or analyze any web results before the cutoff, so the planned evidence-gathering process was not completed.\n\nWorking history summary\n- Objective: Predict the outcome of “Benfica vs. Nice (around 2025-08-13T03:00:00Z)” with options A (Benfica), B (Tie), C (Nice), using only information available before 2025-08-13T03:00:00Z.\n- Plan:\n  1) Identify pre-cutoff listings, previews, and odds for the match.\n  2) Extract odds, team news, recent form, venue/neutral-site context.\n  3) Synthesize a prediction among A/B/C, documenting uncertainties.\n- Tool usage (one call total):\n  - Purpose: Find pre-cutoff previews/odds and match listings.\n  - Query: “Benfica vs Nice August 2025 preview odds friendly match Benfica Nice 2025”\n  - Parameters: num_results=10; end_published_date=2025-08-13; use_autoprompt=true.\n  - Results: None received or analyzed before session ended.\n\nWhat was known vs. unknown\n- Known: Opponents (Benfica vs. Nice) and approximate time window around 2025-08-13T03:00:00Z.\n- Unknown: Competition type (friendly vs. competitive), venue/neutral site, exact kickoff, squad availability, injuries/transfers, and pre-match odds or model-based previews.\n\nReasoning based on priors (since no retrieved evidence was processed)\n- Team strength priors before Aug 2025:\n  - Benfica: Consistent top-tier Portuguese club, strong UEFA coefficient/club ELO, deep squad, regularly favored vs. mid-to-upper mid-table sides from other leagues in neutral/preseason contexts.\n  - Nice: Competitive Ligue 1 side, typically below Europe’s top tier; solid defensively with variable attacking output.\n- Timing and venue implications:\n  - Mid-August often corresponds to late preseason or early-season fixtures. A ~03:00Z kickoff suggests a potential neutral/overseas venue (e.g., North America), which reduces home advantage but usually still leaves the stronger team favored.\n- Market tendency heuristic:\n  - In neutral/preseason matches of this pairing, bookmakers typically price Benfica as favorites, with draw as the next most likely outcome, and a Nice win as the longest odds.\n\nUncertainties\n- Without concrete pre-cutoff odds, news, and confirmed venue/competition, outcome probabilities may shift meaningfully (e.g., heavy rotation in a friendly, recent transfers/injuries, or a competitive format incentivizing a draw). These uncertainties could raise the likelihood of B (Tie) or, less commonly, C (Nice).\n\nPlausible options identified\n- A (Benfica): Most plausible on general strength and typical pricing.\n- B (Tie): Plausible, especially in preseason or neutral contexts with rotations.\n- C (Nice): Possible but typically least likely absent specific contrary evidence.\n\nFinal answer\n\\boxed{A}",
