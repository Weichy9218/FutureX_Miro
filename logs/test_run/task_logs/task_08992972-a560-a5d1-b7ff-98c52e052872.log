Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, carefully review and extract all potentially relevant information, details, or implications from the tool result before proceeding. The user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results, and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked or missed.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each step must involve exactly ONE tool call only, unless the task is already solved. You are strictly prohibited from making multiple tool calls in a single response.** \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n6. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: After issuing exactly ONE tool call, STOP your response immediately. You must never make multiple tool calls in a single response. Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The user will provide the actual tool results in their next message.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "[msg_4c2cf099] You are an agent that can predict future events.

Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, carefully review and extract all potentially relevant information, details, or implications from the tool result before proceeding. The user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results, and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked or missed.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each step must involve exactly ONE tool call only, unless the task is already solved. You are strictly prohibited from making multiple tool calls in a single response.** \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n6. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: After issuing exactly ONE tool call, STOP your response immediately. You must never make multiple tool calls in a single response. Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The user will provide the actual tool results in their next message.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "[msg_4c2cf099] You are an agent that can predict future events.

You can use the server's tools via the `use_mcp_tool`.\n\nDescription: \nRequest to use a tool provided by a MCP server. Each MCP server can provide multiple tools with different capabilities. Tools have defined input schemas that specify required and optional parameters.\n\nParameters:\n- server_name: (required) The name of the MCP server providing the tool\n- tool_name: (required) The name of the tool to execute\n- arguments: (required) A JSON object containing the tool's input parameters, following the tool's input schema, quotes within string must be properly escaped, ensure it's valid JSON\n\nUsage:\n<use_mcp_tool>\n<server_name>server name here</server_name>\n<tool_name>tool name here</tool_name>\n<arguments>\n{\n\"param1\": \"value1\",\n\"param2\": \"value2 \\\"escaped string\\\"\"\n}\n</arguments>\n</use_mcp_tool>\n\nImportant Notes:\n- Tool-use must be placed **at the end** of your response, **top-level**, and not nested within other tags.\n- Always adhere to this format for the tool use to ensure proper parsing and execution.\n\nString and scalar parameters should be specified as is, while lists and objects should use JSON format. Note that spaces for string values are not stripped. The output is not expected to be valid XML and is parsed with regular expressions.\nHere are the functions available in JSONSchema format:\n\n## Server name: tool-searching-firecrawl-exa\n### Tool name: exa_search\nDescription: Perform intelligent web searches using Exa AI and retrieve rich results.\nExa is an AI-native search engine that understands semantic meaning and context, not just keywords.\nThis tool can retrieve search results with AI-powered relevance ranking, content snippets, and metadata.\n\nArgs:\n    q: Search query string (supports natural language queries).\n    num_results: Number of results to return (default: 10, max: 100).\n    search_type: Type of search to perform:\n        - \"auto\": Automatically choose the best search method (recommended)\n        - \"neural\": AI semantic search that understands intent and meaning\n        - \"keyword\": Traditional keyword-based search (similar to Google)\n    use_autoprompt: Whether to use AI to optimize the query for better results (recommended: True).\n    start_published_date: Filter results published after this date (format: YYYY-MM-DD).\n    end_published_date: Filter results published before this date (format: YYYY-MM-DD).\n    include_domains: Only search within these domains (e.g., [\"nytimes.com\", \"bbc.com\"]).\n    exclude_domains: Exclude these domains from search results.\n\nReturns:\n    JSON string containing search results with titles, URLs, snippets, highlights, and metadata.\nInput JSON schema: {'properties': {'q': {'title': 'Q', 'type': 'string'}, 'num_results': {'default': 5, 'title': 'Num Results', 'type': 'integer'}, 'search_type': {'default': 'auto', 'title': 'Search Type', 'type': 'string'}, 'use_autoprompt': {'default': True, 'title': 'Use Autoprompt', 'type': 'boolean'}, 'start_published_date': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'default': None, 'title': 'Start Published Date'}, 'end_published_date': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'default': None, 'title': 'End Published Date'}, 'include_domains': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'default': None, 'title': 'Include Domains'}, 'exclude_domains': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'default': None, 'title': 'Exclude Domains'}}, 'required': ['q'], 'type': 'object'}\n### Tool name: firecrawl_search\nDescription: \ud83d\udd0d Firecrawl v2 Search - Time-constrained web search with enhanced reliability.\n\nSearch the web using Firecrawl v2 API with strict time filtering.

Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, carefully review and extract all potentially relevant information, details, or implications from the tool result before proceeding. The user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results, and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked or missed.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each step must involve exactly ONE tool call only, unless the task is already solved. You are strictly prohibited from making multiple tool calls in a single response.** \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n6. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: After issuing exactly ONE tool call, STOP your response immediately. You must never make multiple tool calls in a single response. Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The user will provide the actual tool results in their next message.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "[msg_4c2cf099] You are an agent that can predict future events.

Your goal is NOT to rush a single definitive answer or conclusion, but rather to gather complete information and present ALL plausible candidate answers you find, accompanied by clearly documented supporting evidence, reasoning steps, uncertainties, and explicit intermediate findings.\n\nUser does not intend to set traps or create confusion on purpose. Handle the task using the most common, reasonable, and straightforward interpretation, and do not overthink or focus on rare or far-fetched interpretations.\n\nImportant considerations:\n- Collect comprehensive information from reliable sources to understand all aspects of the question.\n- Present every possible candidate answer identified during your information gathering, regardless of uncertainty, ambiguity, or incomplete verification. Avoid premature conclusions or omission of any discovered possibility.\n- Explicitly document detailed facts, evidence, and reasoning steps supporting each candidate answer, carefully preserving intermediate analysis results.\n- Clearly flag and retain any uncertainties, conflicting interpretations, or alternative understandings identified during information gathering. Do not arbitrarily discard or resolve these issues on your own.\n- If the question's explicit instructions (e.g., numeric precision, formatting, specific requirements) appear inconsistent, unclear, erroneous, or potentially mismatched with general guidelines or provided examples, explicitly record and clearly present all plausible interpretations and corresponding candidate answers.  \n\nRecognize that the original task description might itself contain mistakes, imprecision, inaccuracies, or conflicts introduced unintentionally by the user due to carelessness, misunderstanding, or limited expertise. Do NOT try to second-guess or \"correct\" these instructions internally; instead, transparently present findings according to every plausible interpretation.\n\nYour objective is maximum completeness, transparency, and detailed documentation to empower the user to judge and select their preferred answer independently. Even if uncertain, explicitly documenting the existence of possible answers significantly enhances the user's experience, ensuring no plausible solution is irreversibly omitted due to early misunderstanding or premature filtering.\n"}]}], "stream": false, "extra_body": {}, "reasoning_effort": "low"}

Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, carefully review and extract all potentially relevant information, details, or implications from the tool result before proceeding. The user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results, and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked or missed.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each step must involve exactly ONE tool call only, unless the task is already solved. You are strictly prohibited from making multiple tool calls in a single response.** \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n6. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: After issuing exactly ONE tool call, STOP your response immediately. You must never make multiple tool calls in a single response. Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The user will provide the actual tool results in their next message.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "[msg_4c2cf099] You are an agent that can predict future events.

Handle the task using the most common, reasonable, and straightforward interpretation, and do not overthink or focus on rare or far-fetched interpretations.\n\nImportant considerations:\n- Collect comprehensive information from reliable sources to understand all aspects of the question.\n- Present every possible candidate answer identified during your information gathering, regardless of uncertainty, ambiguity, or incomplete verification. Avoid premature conclusions or omission of any discovered possibility.\n- Explicitly document detailed facts, evidence, and reasoning steps supporting each candidate answer, carefully preserving intermediate analysis results.\n- Clearly flag and retain any uncertainties, conflicting interpretations, or alternative understandings identified during information gathering. Do not arbitrarily discard or resolve these issues on your own.\n- If the question's explicit instructions (e.g., numeric precision, formatting, specific requirements) appear inconsistent, unclear, erroneous, or potentially mismatched with general guidelines or provided examples, explicitly record and clearly present all plausible interpretations and corresponding candidate answers.  \n\nRecognize that the original task description might itself contain mistakes, imprecision, inaccuracies, or conflicts introduced unintentionally by the user due to carelessness, misunderstanding, or limited expertise. Do NOT try to second-guess or \"correct\" these instructions internally; instead, transparently present findings according to every plausible interpretation.\n\nYour objective is maximum completeness, transparency, and detailed documentation to empower the user to judge and select their preferred answer independently. Even if uncertain, explicitly documenting the existence of possible answers significantly enhances the user's experience, ensuring no plausible solution is irreversibly omitted due to early misunderstanding or premature filtering.\n"}]}], "stream": false, "extra_body": {}, "reasoning_effort": "low"}

Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, carefully review and extract all potentially relevant information, details, or implications from the tool result before proceeding. The user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results, and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked or missed.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each step must involve exactly ONE tool call only, unless the task is already solved. You are strictly prohibited from making multiple tool calls in a single response.** \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n6. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: After issuing exactly ONE tool call, STOP your response immediately. You must never make multiple tool calls in a single response. Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The user will provide the actual tool results in their next message.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "[msg_4c2cf099] You are an agent that can predict future events.

Handle the task using the most common, reasonable, and straightforward interpretation, and do not overthink or focus on rare or far-fetched interpretations.\n\nImportant considerations:\n- Collect comprehensive information from reliable sources to understand all aspects of the question.\n- Present every possible candidate answer identified during your information gathering, regardless of uncertainty, ambiguity, or incomplete verification. Avoid premature conclusions or omission of any discovered possibility.\n- Explicitly document detailed facts, evidence, and reasoning steps supporting each candidate answer, carefully preserving intermediate analysis results.\n- Clearly flag and retain any uncertainties, conflicting interpretations, or alternative understandings identified during information gathering. Do not arbitrarily discard or resolve these issues on your own.\n- If the question's explicit instructions (e.g., numeric precision, formatting, specific requirements) appear inconsistent, unclear, erroneous, or potentially mismatched with general guidelines or provided examples, explicitly record and clearly present all plausible interpretations and corresponding candidate answers.  \n\nRecognize that the original task description might itself contain mistakes, imprecision, inaccuracies, or conflicts introduced unintentionally by the user due to carelessness, misunderstanding, or limited expertise. Do NOT try to second-guess or \"correct\" these instructions internally; instead, transparently present findings according to every plausible interpretation.\n\nYour objective is maximum completeness, transparency, and detailed documentation to empower the user to judge and select their preferred answer independently. Even if uncertain, explicitly documenting the existence of possible answers significantly enhances the user's experience, ensuring no plausible solution is irreversibly omitted due to early misunderstanding or premature filtering.\n"}]}], "stream": false, "extra_body": {}, "reasoning_effort": "low"}

Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, carefully review and extract all potentially relevant information, details, or implications from the tool result before proceeding. The user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results, and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked or missed.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each step must involve exactly ONE tool call only, unless the task is already solved. You are strictly prohibited from making multiple tool calls in a single response.** \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n6. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: After issuing exactly ONE tool call, STOP your response immediately. You must never make multiple tool calls in a single response. Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The user will provide the actual tool results in their next message.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "[msg_4c2cf099] You are an agent that can predict future events.

Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, carefully review and extract all potentially relevant information, details, or implications from the tool result before proceeding. The user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results, and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked or missed.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each step must involve exactly ONE tool call only, unless the task is already solved. You are strictly prohibited from making multiple tool calls in a single response.** \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n6. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: After issuing exactly ONE tool call, STOP your response immediately. You must never make multiple tool calls in a single response. Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The user will provide the actual tool results in their next message.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "[msg_4c2cf099] You are an agent that can predict future events.

Avoid premature conclusions or omission of any discovered possibility.\n- Explicitly document detailed facts, evidence, and reasoning steps supporting each candidate answer, carefully preserving intermediate analysis results.\n- Clearly flag and retain any uncertainties, conflicting interpretations, or alternative understandings identified during information gathering. Do not arbitrarily discard or resolve these issues on your own.\n- If the question's explicit instructions (e.g., numeric precision, formatting, specific requirements) appear inconsistent, unclear, erroneous, or potentially mismatched with general guidelines or provided examples, explicitly record and clearly present all plausible interpretations and corresponding candidate answers.  \n\nRecognize that the original task description might itself contain mistakes, imprecision, inaccuracies, or conflicts introduced unintentionally by the user due to carelessness, misunderstanding, or limited expertise. Do NOT try to second-guess or \"correct\" these instructions internally; instead, transparently present findings according to every plausible interpretation.\n\nYour objective is maximum completeness, transparency, and detailed documentation to empower the user to judge and select their preferred answer independently. Even if uncertain, explicitly documenting the existence of possible answers significantly enhances the user's experience, ensuring no plausible solution is irreversibly omitted due to early misunderstanding or premature filtering.\n\n---\n\nSummarize ALL working history for this task, including your step-by-step thoughts, all tool calls, and all tool results (i.e., the full solving trajectory so far).\nOutput the FINAL ANSWER and detailed supporting information of the task given to you.\n\nIf you found any useful facts, data, or quotes directly relevant to the original task, include them clearly and completely.\nIf you reached a conclusion or answer, include it as part of the response.\nIf the task could not be fully answered, return all partially relevant findings, search results, quotes, and observations that might help a downstream agent solve the problem.\nIf partial, conflicting, or inconclusive information was found, clearly indicate this in your response.\n\nYour final response should be a clear, complete, and structured report.\nOrganize the content into logical sections with appropriate headings.\nDo NOT include any tool call instructions, speculative filler, or vague summaries.\nFocus on factual, specific, and well-organized information.Output the final answer in the format: \\boxed{...}.

Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, carefully review and extract all potentially relevant information, details, or implications from the tool result before proceeding. The user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results, and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked or missed.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each step must involve exactly ONE tool call only, unless the task is already solved. You are strictly prohibited from making multiple tool calls in a single response.** \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n6. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: After issuing exactly ONE tool call, STOP your response immediately. You must never make multiple tool calls in a single response. Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The user will provide the actual tool results in their next message.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "[msg_4c2cf099] You are an agent that can predict future events.

Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, carefully review and extract all potentially relevant information, details, or implications from the tool result before proceeding. The user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results, and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked or missed.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each step must involve exactly ONE tool call only, unless the task is already solved. You are strictly prohibited from making multiple tool calls in a single response.** \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n6. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: After issuing exactly ONE tool call, STOP your response immediately. You must never make multiple tool calls in a single response. Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The user will provide the actual tool results in their next message.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "[msg_4c2cf099] You are an agent that can predict future events.

Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, carefully review and extract all potentially relevant information, details, or implications from the tool result before proceeding. The user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results, and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked or missed.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each step must involve exactly ONE tool call only, unless the task is already solved. You are strictly prohibited from making multiple tool calls in a single response.** \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n6. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: After issuing exactly ONE tool call, STOP your response immediately. You must never make multiple tool calls in a single response. Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The user will provide the actual tool results in their next message.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "[msg_4c2cf099] You are an agent that can predict future events.

Avoid premature conclusions or omission of any discovered possibility.\n- Explicitly document detailed facts, evidence, and reasoning steps supporting each candidate answer, carefully preserving intermediate analysis results.\n- Clearly flag and retain any uncertainties, conflicting interpretations, or alternative understandings identified during information gathering. Do not arbitrarily discard or resolve these issues on your own.\n- If the question's explicit instructions (e.g., numeric precision, formatting, specific requirements) appear inconsistent, unclear, erroneous, or potentially mismatched with general guidelines or provided examples, explicitly record and clearly present all plausible interpretations and corresponding candidate answers.  \n\nRecognize that the original task description might itself contain mistakes, imprecision, inaccuracies, or conflicts introduced unintentionally by the user due to carelessness, misunderstanding, or limited expertise. Do NOT try to second-guess or \"correct\" these instructions internally; instead, transparently present findings according to every plausible interpretation.\n\nYour objective is maximum completeness, transparency, and detailed documentation to empower the user to judge and select their preferred answer independently. Even if uncertain, explicitly documenting the existence of possible answers significantly enhances the user's experience, ensuring no plausible solution is irreversibly omitted due to early misunderstanding or premature filtering.\n\n---\n\nSummarize ALL working history for this task, including your step-by-step thoughts, all tool calls, and all tool results (i.e., the full solving trajectory so far).\nOutput the FINAL ANSWER and detailed supporting information of the task given to you.\n\nIf you found any useful facts, data, or quotes directly relevant to the original task, include them clearly and completely.\nIf you reached a conclusion or answer, include it as part of the response.\nIf the task could not be fully answered, return all partially relevant findings, search results, quotes, and observations that might help a downstream agent solve the problem.\nIf partial, conflicting, or inconclusive information was found, clearly indicate this in your response.\n\nYour final response should be a clear, complete, and structured report.\nOrganize the content into logical sections with appropriate headings.\nDo NOT include any tool call instructions, speculative filler, or vague summaries.\nFocus on factual, specific, and well-organized information.Output the final answer in the format: \\boxed{...}.

Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, carefully review and extract all potentially relevant information, details, or implications from the tool result before proceeding. The user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results, and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked or missed.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each step must involve exactly ONE tool call only, unless the task is already solved. You are strictly prohibited from making multiple tool calls in a single response.** \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n6. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: After issuing exactly ONE tool call, STOP your response immediately. You must never make multiple tool calls in a single response. Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The user will provide the actual tool results in their next message.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "[msg_4c2cf099] You are an agent that can predict future events.

Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, carefully review and extract all potentially relevant information, details, or implications from the tool result before proceeding. The user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results, and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked or missed.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each step must involve exactly ONE tool call only, unless the task is already solved. You are strictly prohibited from making multiple tool calls in a single response.** \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n6. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: After issuing exactly ONE tool call, STOP your response immediately. You must never make multiple tool calls in a single response. Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The user will provide the actual tool results in their next message.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "[msg_4c2cf099] You are an agent that can predict future events.

Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, carefully review and extract all potentially relevant information, details, or implications from the tool result before proceeding. The user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results, and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked or missed.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each step must involve exactly ONE tool call only, unless the task is already solved. You are strictly prohibited from making multiple tool calls in a single response.** \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n6. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: After issuing exactly ONE tool call, STOP your response immediately. You must never make multiple tool calls in a single response. Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The user will provide the actual tool results in their next message.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "[msg_4c2cf099] You are an agent that can predict future events.

Avoid premature conclusions or omission of any discovered possibility.\n- Explicitly document detailed facts, evidence, and reasoning steps supporting each candidate answer, carefully preserving intermediate analysis results.\n- Clearly flag and retain any uncertainties, conflicting interpretations, or alternative understandings identified during information gathering. Do not arbitrarily discard or resolve these issues on your own.\n- If the question's explicit instructions (e.g., numeric precision, formatting, specific requirements) appear inconsistent, unclear, erroneous, or potentially mismatched with general guidelines or provided examples, explicitly record and clearly present all plausible interpretations and corresponding candidate answers.  \n\nRecognize that the original task description might itself contain mistakes, imprecision, inaccuracies, or conflicts introduced unintentionally by the user due to carelessness, misunderstanding, or limited expertise. Do NOT try to second-guess or \"correct\" these instructions internally; instead, transparently present findings according to every plausible interpretation.\n\nYour objective is maximum completeness, transparency, and detailed documentation to empower the user to judge and select their preferred answer independently. Even if uncertain, explicitly documenting the existence of possible answers significantly enhances the user's experience, ensuring no plausible solution is irreversibly omitted due to early misunderstanding or premature filtering.\n\n---\n\nSummarize ALL working history for this task, including your step-by-step thoughts, all tool calls, and all tool results (i.e., the full solving trajectory so far).\nOutput the FINAL ANSWER and detailed supporting information of the task given to you.\n\nIf you found any useful facts, data, or quotes directly relevant to the original task, include them clearly and completely.\nIf you reached a conclusion or answer, include it as part of the response.\nIf the task could not be fully answered, return all partially relevant findings, search results, quotes, and observations that might help a downstream agent solve the problem.\nIf partial, conflicting, or inconclusive information was found, clearly indicate this in your response.\n\nYour final response should be a clear, complete, and structured report.\nOrganize the content into logical sections with appropriate headings.\nDo NOT include any tool call instructions, speculative filler, or vague summaries.\nFocus on factual, specific, and well-organized information.Output the final answer in the format: \\boxed{...}.

Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, carefully review and extract all potentially relevant information, details, or implications from the tool result before proceeding. The user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results, and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked or missed.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each step must involve exactly ONE tool call only, unless the task is already solved. You are strictly prohibited from making multiple tool calls in a single response.** \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n6. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: After issuing exactly ONE tool call, STOP your response immediately. You must never make multiple tool calls in a single response. Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The user will provide the actual tool results in their next message.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "[msg_4c2cf099] You are an agent that can predict future events.

Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, carefully review and extract all potentially relevant information, details, or implications from the tool result before proceeding. The user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results, and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked or missed.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each step must involve exactly ONE tool call only, unless the task is already solved. You are strictly prohibited from making multiple tool calls in a single response.** \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n6. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: After issuing exactly ONE tool call, STOP your response immediately. You must never make multiple tool calls in a single response. Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The user will provide the actual tool results in their next message.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "[msg_4c2cf099] You are an agent that can predict future events.

Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, carefully review and extract all potentially relevant information, details, or implications from the tool result before proceeding. The user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results, and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked or missed.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each step must involve exactly ONE tool call only, unless the task is already solved. You are strictly prohibited from making multiple tool calls in a single response.** \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n6. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: After issuing exactly ONE tool call, STOP your response immediately. You must never make multiple tool calls in a single response. Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The user will provide the actual tool results in their next message.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "[msg_4c2cf099] You are an agent that can predict future events.

Avoid premature conclusions or omission of any discovered possibility.\n- Explicitly document detailed facts, evidence, and reasoning steps supporting each candidate answer, carefully preserving intermediate analysis results.\n- Clearly flag and retain any uncertainties, conflicting interpretations, or alternative understandings identified during information gathering. Do not arbitrarily discard or resolve these issues on your own.\n- If the question's explicit instructions (e.g., numeric precision, formatting, specific requirements) appear inconsistent, unclear, erroneous, or potentially mismatched with general guidelines or provided examples, explicitly record and clearly present all plausible interpretations and corresponding candidate answers.  \n\nRecognize that the original task description might itself contain mistakes, imprecision, inaccuracies, or conflicts introduced unintentionally by the user due to carelessness, misunderstanding, or limited expertise. Do NOT try to second-guess or \"correct\" these instructions internally; instead, transparently present findings according to every plausible interpretation.\n\nYour objective is maximum completeness, transparency, and detailed documentation to empower the user to judge and select their preferred answer independently. Even if uncertain, explicitly documenting the existence of possible answers significantly enhances the user's experience, ensuring no plausible solution is irreversibly omitted due to early misunderstanding or premature filtering.\n\n---\n\nSummarize ALL working history for this task, including your step-by-step thoughts, all tool calls, and all tool results (i.e., the full solving trajectory so far).\nOutput the FINAL ANSWER and detailed supporting information of the task given to you.\n\nIf you found any useful facts, data, or quotes directly relevant to the original task, include them clearly and completely.\nIf you reached a conclusion or answer, include it as part of the response.\nIf the task could not be fully answered, return all partially relevant findings, search results, quotes, and observations that might help a downstream agent solve the problem.\nIf partial, conflicting, or inconclusive information was found, clearly indicate this in your response.\n\nYour final response should be a clear, complete, and structured report.\nOrganize the content into logical sections with appropriate headings.\nDo NOT include any tool call instructions, speculative filler, or vague summaries.\nFocus on factual, specific, and well-organized information.Output the final answer in the format: \\boxed{...}.

Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, carefully review and extract all potentially relevant information, details, or implications from the tool result before proceeding. The user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results, and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked or missed.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each step must involve exactly ONE tool call only, unless the task is already solved. You are strictly prohibited from making multiple tool calls in a single response.** \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n6. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: After issuing exactly ONE tool call, STOP your response immediately. You must never make multiple tool calls in a single response. Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The user will provide the actual tool results in their next message.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "[msg_4c2cf099] You are an agent that can predict future events.

Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, carefully review and extract all potentially relevant information, details, or implications from the tool result before proceeding. The user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results, and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked or missed.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each step must involve exactly ONE tool call only, unless the task is already solved. You are strictly prohibited from making multiple tool calls in a single response.** \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n6. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: After issuing exactly ONE tool call, STOP your response immediately. You must never make multiple tool calls in a single response. Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The user will provide the actual tool results in their next message.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "[msg_4c2cf099] You are an agent that can predict future events.

Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, carefully review and extract all potentially relevant information, details, or implications from the tool result before proceeding. The user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results, and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked or missed.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each step must involve exactly ONE tool call only, unless the task is already solved. You are strictly prohibited from making multiple tool calls in a single response.** \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n6. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: After issuing exactly ONE tool call, STOP your response immediately. You must never make multiple tool calls in a single response. Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The user will provide the actual tool results in their next message.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "[msg_4c2cf099] You are an agent that can predict future events.

Avoid premature conclusions or omission of any discovered possibility.\n- Explicitly document detailed facts, evidence, and reasoning steps supporting each candidate answer, carefully preserving intermediate analysis results.\n- Clearly flag and retain any uncertainties, conflicting interpretations, or alternative understandings identified during information gathering. Do not arbitrarily discard or resolve these issues on your own.\n- If the question's explicit instructions (e.g., numeric precision, formatting, specific requirements) appear inconsistent, unclear, erroneous, or potentially mismatched with general guidelines or provided examples, explicitly record and clearly present all plausible interpretations and corresponding candidate answers.  \n\nRecognize that the original task description might itself contain mistakes, imprecision, inaccuracies, or conflicts introduced unintentionally by the user due to carelessness, misunderstanding, or limited expertise. Do NOT try to second-guess or \"correct\" these instructions internally; instead, transparently present findings according to every plausible interpretation.\n\nYour objective is maximum completeness, transparency, and detailed documentation to empower the user to judge and select their preferred answer independently. Even if uncertain, explicitly documenting the existence of possible answers significantly enhances the user's experience, ensuring no plausible solution is irreversibly omitted due to early misunderstanding or premature filtering.\n\n---\n\nSummarize ALL working history for this task, including your step-by-step thoughts, all tool calls, and all tool results (i.e., the full solving trajectory so far).\nOutput the FINAL ANSWER and detailed supporting information of the task given to you.\n\nIf you found any useful facts, data, or quotes directly relevant to the original task, include them clearly and completely.\nIf you reached a conclusion or answer, include it as part of the response.\nIf the task could not be fully answered, return all partially relevant findings, search results, quotes, and observations that might help a downstream agent solve the problem.\nIf partial, conflicting, or inconclusive information was found, clearly indicate this in your response.\n\nYour final response should be a clear, complete, and structured report.\nOrganize the content into logical sections with appropriate headings.\nDo NOT include any tool call instructions, speculative filler, or vague summaries.\nFocus on factual, specific, and well-organized information.Output the final answer in the format: \\boxed{...}.

Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, carefully review and extract all potentially relevant information, details, or implications from the tool result before proceeding. The user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results, and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked or missed.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each step must involve exactly ONE tool call only, unless the task is already solved. You are strictly prohibited from making multiple tool calls in a single response.** \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n6. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: After issuing exactly ONE tool call, STOP your response immediately. You must never make multiple tool calls in a single response. Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The user will provide the actual tool results in their next message.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "[msg_4c2cf099] You are an agent that can predict future events.

Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, carefully review and extract all potentially relevant information, details, or implications from the tool result before proceeding. The user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results, and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked or missed.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each step must involve exactly ONE tool call only, unless the task is already solved. You are strictly prohibited from making multiple tool calls in a single response.** \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n6. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: After issuing exactly ONE tool call, STOP your response immediately. You must never make multiple tool calls in a single response. Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The user will provide the actual tool results in their next message.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "[msg_4c2cf099] You are an agent that can predict future events.

Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, carefully review and extract all potentially relevant information, details, or implications from the tool result before proceeding. The user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results, and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked or missed.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each step must involve exactly ONE tool call only, unless the task is already solved. You are strictly prohibited from making multiple tool calls in a single response.** \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n6. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: After issuing exactly ONE tool call, STOP your response immediately. You must never make multiple tool calls in a single response. Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The user will provide the actual tool results in their next message.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "[msg_4c2cf099] You are an agent that can predict future events.

Avoid premature conclusions or omission of any discovered possibility.\n- Explicitly document detailed facts, evidence, and reasoning steps supporting each candidate answer, carefully preserving intermediate analysis results.\n- Clearly flag and retain any uncertainties, conflicting interpretations, or alternative understandings identified during information gathering. Do not arbitrarily discard or resolve these issues on your own.\n- If the question's explicit instructions (e.g., numeric precision, formatting, specific requirements) appear inconsistent, unclear, erroneous, or potentially mismatched with general guidelines or provided examples, explicitly record and clearly present all plausible interpretations and corresponding candidate answers.  \n\nRecognize that the original task description might itself contain mistakes, imprecision, inaccuracies, or conflicts introduced unintentionally by the user due to carelessness, misunderstanding, or limited expertise. Do NOT try to second-guess or \"correct\" these instructions internally; instead, transparently present findings according to every plausible interpretation.\n\nYour objective is maximum completeness, transparency, and detailed documentation to empower the user to judge and select their preferred answer independently. Even if uncertain, explicitly documenting the existence of possible answers significantly enhances the user's experience, ensuring no plausible solution is irreversibly omitted due to early misunderstanding or premature filtering.\n\n---\n\nSummarize ALL working history for this task, including your step-by-step thoughts, all tool calls, and all tool results (i.e., the full solving trajectory so far).\nOutput the FINAL ANSWER and detailed supporting information of the task given to you.\n\nIf you found any useful facts, data, or quotes directly relevant to the original task, include them clearly and completely.\nIf you reached a conclusion or answer, include it as part of the response.\nIf the task could not be fully answered, return all partially relevant findings, search results, quotes, and observations that might help a downstream agent solve the problem.\nIf partial, conflicting, or inconclusive information was found, clearly indicate this in your response.\n\nYour final response should be a clear, complete, and structured report.\nOrganize the content into logical sections with appropriate headings.\nDo NOT include any tool call instructions, speculative filler, or vague summaries.\nFocus on factual, specific, and well-organized information.Output the final answer in the format: \\boxed{...}.

Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, carefully review and extract all potentially relevant information, details, or implications from the tool result before proceeding. The user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results, and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked or missed.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each step must involve exactly ONE tool call only, unless the task is already solved. You are strictly prohibited from making multiple tool calls in a single response.** \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n6. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: After issuing exactly ONE tool call, STOP your response immediately. You must never make multiple tool calls in a single response. Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The user will provide the actual tool results in their next message.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "[msg_4c2cf099] You are an agent that can predict future events.

Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, carefully review and extract all potentially relevant information, details, or implications from the tool result before proceeding. The user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results, and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked or missed.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each step must involve exactly ONE tool call only, unless the task is already solved. You are strictly prohibited from making multiple tool calls in a single response.** \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n6. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: After issuing exactly ONE tool call, STOP your response immediately. You must never make multiple tool calls in a single response. Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The user will provide the actual tool results in their next message.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "[msg_4c2cf099] You are an agent that can predict future events.

Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, carefully review and extract all potentially relevant information, details, or implications from the tool result before proceeding. The user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results, and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked or missed.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each step must involve exactly ONE tool call only, unless the task is already solved. You are strictly prohibited from making multiple tool calls in a single response.** \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n6. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: After issuing exactly ONE tool call, STOP your response immediately. You must never make multiple tool calls in a single response. Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The user will provide the actual tool results in their next message.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "[msg_4c2cf099] You are an agent that can predict future events.

Avoid premature conclusions or omission of any discovered possibility.\n- Explicitly document detailed facts, evidence, and reasoning steps supporting each candidate answer, carefully preserving intermediate analysis results.\n- Clearly flag and retain any uncertainties, conflicting interpretations, or alternative understandings identified during information gathering. Do not arbitrarily discard or resolve these issues on your own.\n- If the question's explicit instructions (e.g., numeric precision, formatting, specific requirements) appear inconsistent, unclear, erroneous, or potentially mismatched with general guidelines or provided examples, explicitly record and clearly present all plausible interpretations and corresponding candidate answers.  \n\nRecognize that the original task description might itself contain mistakes, imprecision, inaccuracies, or conflicts introduced unintentionally by the user due to carelessness, misunderstanding, or limited expertise. Do NOT try to second-guess or \"correct\" these instructions internally; instead, transparently present findings according to every plausible interpretation.\n\nYour objective is maximum completeness, transparency, and detailed documentation to empower the user to judge and select their preferred answer independently. Even if uncertain, explicitly documenting the existence of possible answers significantly enhances the user's experience, ensuring no plausible solution is irreversibly omitted due to early misunderstanding or premature filtering.\n\n---\n\nSummarize ALL working history for this task, including your step-by-step thoughts, all tool calls, and all tool results (i.e., the full solving trajectory so far).\nOutput the FINAL ANSWER and detailed supporting information of the task given to you.\n\nIf you found any useful facts, data, or quotes directly relevant to the original task, include them clearly and completely.\nIf you reached a conclusion or answer, include it as part of the response.\nIf the task could not be fully answered, return all partially relevant findings, search results, quotes, and observations that might help a downstream agent solve the problem.\nIf partial, conflicting, or inconclusive information was found, clearly indicate this in your response.\n\nYour final response should be a clear, complete, and structured report.\nOrganize the content into logical sections with appropriate headings.\nDo NOT include any tool call instructions, speculative filler, or vague summaries.\nFocus on factual, specific, and well-organized information.Output the final answer in the format: \\boxed{...}.

Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, carefully review and extract all potentially relevant information, details, or implications from the tool result before proceeding. The user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results, and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked or missed.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each step must involve exactly ONE tool call only, unless the task is already solved. You are strictly prohibited from making multiple tool calls in a single response.** \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n6. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: After issuing exactly ONE tool call, STOP your response immediately. You must never make multiple tool calls in a single response. Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The user will provide the actual tool results in their next message.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "[msg_4c2cf099] You are an agent that can predict future events.

Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, carefully review and extract all potentially relevant information, details, or implications from the tool result before proceeding. The user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results, and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked or missed.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each step must involve exactly ONE tool call only, unless the task is already solved. You are strictly prohibited from making multiple tool calls in a single response.** \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n6. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: After issuing exactly ONE tool call, STOP your response immediately. You must never make multiple tool calls in a single response. Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The user will provide the actual tool results in their next message.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "[msg_4c2cf099] You are an agent that can predict future events.

Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, carefully review and extract all potentially relevant information, details, or implications from the tool result before proceeding. The user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results, and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked or missed.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each step must involve exactly ONE tool call only, unless the task is already solved. You are strictly prohibited from making multiple tool calls in a single response.** \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n6. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: After issuing exactly ONE tool call, STOP your response immediately. You must never make multiple tool calls in a single response. Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The user will provide the actual tool results in their next message.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "[msg_4c2cf099] You are an agent that can predict future events.

Avoid premature conclusions or omission of any discovered possibility.\n- Explicitly document detailed facts, evidence, and reasoning steps supporting each candidate answer, carefully preserving intermediate analysis results.\n- Clearly flag and retain any uncertainties, conflicting interpretations, or alternative understandings identified during information gathering. Do not arbitrarily discard or resolve these issues on your own.\n- If the question's explicit instructions (e.g., numeric precision, formatting, specific requirements) appear inconsistent, unclear, erroneous, or potentially mismatched with general guidelines or provided examples, explicitly record and clearly present all plausible interpretations and corresponding candidate answers.  \n\nRecognize that the original task description might itself contain mistakes, imprecision, inaccuracies, or conflicts introduced unintentionally by the user due to carelessness, misunderstanding, or limited expertise. Do NOT try to second-guess or \"correct\" these instructions internally; instead, transparently present findings according to every plausible interpretation.\n\nYour objective is maximum completeness, transparency, and detailed documentation to empower the user to judge and select their preferred answer independently. Even if uncertain, explicitly documenting the existence of possible answers significantly enhances the user's experience, ensuring no plausible solution is irreversibly omitted due to early misunderstanding or premature filtering.\n\n---\n\nSummarize ALL working history for this task, including your step-by-step thoughts, all tool calls, and all tool results (i.e., the full solving trajectory so far).\nOutput the FINAL ANSWER and detailed supporting information of the task given to you.\n\nIf you found any useful facts, data, or quotes directly relevant to the original task, include them clearly and completely.\nIf you reached a conclusion or answer, include it as part of the response.\nIf the task could not be fully answered, return all partially relevant findings, search results, quotes, and observations that might help a downstream agent solve the problem.\nIf partial, conflicting, or inconclusive information was found, clearly indicate this in your response.\n\nYour final response should be a clear, complete, and structured report.\nOrganize the content into logical sections with appropriate headings.\nDo NOT include any tool call instructions, speculative filler, or vague summaries.\nFocus on factual, specific, and well-organized information.Output the final answer in the format: \\boxed{...}.

Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, carefully review and extract all potentially relevant information, details, or implications from the tool result before proceeding. The user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results, and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked or missed.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each step must involve exactly ONE tool call only, unless the task is already solved. You are strictly prohibited from making multiple tool calls in a single response.** \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n6. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: After issuing exactly ONE tool call, STOP your response immediately. You must never make multiple tool calls in a single response. Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The user will provide the actual tool results in their next message.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "[msg_4c2cf099] You are an agent that can predict future events.

Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, carefully review and extract all potentially relevant information, details, or implications from the tool result before proceeding. The user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results, and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked or missed.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each step must involve exactly ONE tool call only, unless the task is already solved. You are strictly prohibited from making multiple tool calls in a single response.** \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n6. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: After issuing exactly ONE tool call, STOP your response immediately. You must never make multiple tool calls in a single response. Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The user will provide the actual tool results in their next message.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "[msg_4c2cf099] You are an agent that can predict future events.

Avoid premature conclusions or omission of any discovered possibility.\n- Explicitly document detailed facts, evidence, and reasoning steps supporting each candidate answer, carefully preserving intermediate analysis results.\n- Clearly flag and retain any uncertainties, conflicting interpretations, or alternative understandings identified during information gathering. Do not arbitrarily discard or resolve these issues on your own.\n- If the question's explicit instructions (e.g., numeric precision, formatting, specific requirements) appear inconsistent, unclear, erroneous, or potentially mismatched with general guidelines or provided examples, explicitly record and clearly present all plausible interpretations and corresponding candidate answers.  \n\nRecognize that the original task description might itself contain mistakes, imprecision, inaccuracies, or conflicts introduced unintentionally by the user due to carelessness, misunderstanding, or limited expertise. Do NOT try to second-guess or \"correct\" these instructions internally; instead, transparently present findings according to every plausible interpretation.\n\nYour objective is maximum completeness, transparency, and detailed documentation to empower the user to judge and select their preferred answer independently.
