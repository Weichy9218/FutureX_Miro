Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, carefully review and extract all potentially relevant information, details, or implications from the tool result before proceeding. The user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results, and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked or missed.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each step must involve exactly ONE tool call only, unless the task is already solved. You are strictly prohibited from making multiple tool calls in a single response.** \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n6. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: After issuing exactly ONE tool call, STOP your response immediately. You must never make multiple tool calls in a single response. Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The user will provide the actual tool results in their next message.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n",

Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each step must involve exactly ONE tool call only, unless the task is already solved. You are strictly prohibited from making multiple tool calls in a single response.** \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n6. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: After issuing exactly ONE tool call, STOP your response immediately. You must never make multiple tool calls in a single response. Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The user will provide the actual tool results in their next message.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n"

Above -0.1%\n  B. Above 0.0%\n  C. Above 0.1%\n  D. Above 0.2%\n  E. Above 0.3%\n  F. Above 0.4%\n\n2) Plan\n- Step 1: Gather consensus forecasts (Reuters, Bloomberg, WSJ, bank previews) for July 2025 headline CPI m/m before the cutoff time 2025-08-12T16:29:00Z.\n- Step 2: Extract the forecasted ranges and dispersion, noting any drivers (gasoline, shelter, core goods).\n- Step 3: Map forecasts to thresholds and list all plausible options, then provide a boxed answer.\n\n3) Tool use\n- I used one historical web search with strict end date filtering to find reputable previews/consensus before the cutoff:\n  - Search query used: “US CPI July 2025 preview consensus month-over-month forecast Reuters Bloomberg WSJ Aug 2025”\n  - Parameters: end_published_date set to “2025-08-12,” 10 results, auto search type, autoprompt true.\n- No tool results were returned in this session for me to analyze, and I could not proceed with additional tool calls due to session termination.\n\n4) Findings and evidence\n- No external findings could be recorded because the search results were not returned within this session.\n\nReasoning and uncertainties\n- Without retrieved articles, I relied on general macro patterns and seasonality:\n  - Headline CPI m/m typically clusters around 0.1% to 0.3% in recent years, with 0.4%+ being less common absent strong energy price surges.\n  - July often shows modest seasonal patterns with shelter remaining sticky and gasoline potentially a swing factor. A consensus near 0.2% m/m would be a plausible baseline.\n- Mapping to thresholds:\n  - If m/m is near 0.2%, “Above 0.1%” (C) is plausible.\n  - “Above 0.2%” (D) requires >0.2%, which could occur if energy or certain components run hot; this is plausible but more uncertain.\n  - “Above 0.3%” (E) is possible but less likely without strong energy impulses; still conceivable, but typically not the central case.\n  - “Above 0.4%” (F) would normally require a notable energy spike and/or broad-based pressures; less plausible as a baseline.\n  - Because these thresholds are cumulative, if C is plausible then A and B are also trivially true; however, the intent is to identify the tightest plausible thresholds. Given typical consensus clustering, C is strongly plausible; D is moderately plausible; E is less plausible; F is unlikely.\n\nLimitations\n- I did not obtain or cite specific pre-release consensus numbers (e.g., Reuters/Bloomberg medians) due to the lack of returned search results in this session.\n- Therefore, the prediction is an informed estimate based on general CPI behavior rather than documented consensus.\n\nFinal Answer\n\\boxed{C, D}"

Above -0.1%\n  B. Above 0.0%\n  C. Above 0.1%\n  D. Above 0.2%\n  E. Above 0.3%\n  F. Above 0.4%\n- Plan:\n  1) Collect pre-release consensus/forecasts from reputable sources (Reuters, Bloomberg, WSJ, banks) dated before 2025-08-12T16:29:00Z.\n  2) Extract consensus medians and ranges; note drivers (energy, shelter).\n  3) Map to thresholds and list all plausible options; provide a boxed answer.\n- Tool usage:\n  - A single time-constrained historical search was initiated to retrieve consensus articles before the cutoff. Query targeted July 2025 CPI previews and consensus m/m from major outlets with end_published_date set to 2025-08-12.\n  - No tool results were returned within the session; no articles or data could be analyzed further.\n- As a result, there were no external facts, quotes, or specific consensus figures captured in-session.\n\nReasoning and uncertainties\n- Without retrieved sources, the prediction is based on general CPI behavior and seasonality as of before the cutoff:\n  - Headline CPI m/m commonly falls in the 0.1%–0.3% range absent unusual energy shocks.\n  - Shelter typically contributes a positive, steady component; energy (especially gasoline) is the main swing factor.\n  - A central tendency near 0.2% m/m is a reasonable baseline if conditions are typical.\n- Mapping to thresholds:\n  - C (Above 0.1%): Strongly plausible if the print centers near 0.2%.\n  - D (Above 0.2%): Plausible if energy or other components run modestly hotter than baseline; requires strictly >0.2%.\n  - E (Above 0.3%): Possible but less likely without clear evidence of a stronger energy impulse.\n  - F (Above 0.4%): Unlikely in the absence of a notable energy surge or broad-based strength.\n  - By construction, if C is plausible then A and B are trivially true; the focus is on the tightest plausible thresholds given typical conditions.\n\nLimitations\n- No consensus medians/ranges from Reuters/Bloomberg/WSJ or bank previews were retrieved due to lack of accessible tool results in-session.\n- This increases uncertainty about whether the distribution skewed closer to 0.1% or 0.3%.\n\nFinal answer\n\\boxed{C, D}",
