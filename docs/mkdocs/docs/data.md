## üÜö Why We're Different

!!! quote "Our Philosophy"
    While high-quality data is essential for training advanced models and often kept private, we believe that the path to truly general-purpose agents is still long. That's why we're committed to open-sourcing as much of our data as possible‚Äîincluding raw samples and exploration traces‚Äîto support and accelerate progress across the community.

1. Following the practices of WebThinker, WebAgents, and CognitiveKernel, we report the Best Pass@1, the highest score across three runs, which often reflects stronger performance, though it may exhibit some variability. To provide a more stable measure, we additionally report Pass@1 (Avg@8), which offers greater consistency at the cost of slightly lower scores.

2. For consistency with prior open-source works, we evaluate GAIA-Text-103 using the WebAgents LLM-as-judge template, and report results on GAIA-Val-165 using the official GAIA scorer script.

3. By default, we use open-source tools wherever possible, except for the code tool [E2B](https://github.com/e2b-dev/E2B) and the Google search tool [Serper](https://serper.dev/). We use [Whisper](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo), [Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct), and [Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507) in our implementation. The framework can be easily extended to other open-source tools of your choice.

4. Replacing these open-source tools with commercial alternatives can yield performance gains. Commercial tools were mainly used for multimodal capabilities and certain complex reasoning subtasks. The majority of tasks, including planning, browsing, refinement, navigation, and more, were handled by our models.

1. MiroThinker‚Äôs performance was tested with this repository and open-source tools; other models‚Äô results are from their papers and official sites.

2. As [MiroVerse-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/miromind-ai/MiroVerse-v0.1) mainly contains English data, the model's Chinese capability is limited. We plan to add more Chinese data to improve performance in the next version.

## üß© Examples

!!! example "Sample QA Examples"
    Below are two QA examples synthesized by our data engine (MiroVerse-Voyager1.0).

!!! note "Case 1"
    **Q:** A female lead actress received her first major annual Hindi film performance award for best actress for her role in a late-2000s comedy-drama, directed by the filmmaker who later created a sports-themed drama released in 2023 starring an actress known for completing an athletic triathlon event in Berlin. What is the title of the film for which this actress first won that award?

    **A:** Paa

!!! note "Case 2"
    **Q:** Identify the agricultural practice, unique to a mountain range that forms a border including an independent principality and known for spectacular geologic landforms, that was one of the key reasons for part of the range's inscription as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the decade before the 21st century. This region's history features a brief early-1800s reorganization of provincial boundaries after a liberal revolution in the southern country, and the northern country is globally recognized as the leading tourist destination with the fourth-largest number of heritage sites. What is this traditional agricultural system called?

    **A:** transhumance
